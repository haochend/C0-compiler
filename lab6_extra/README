b6 extra
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The extra work we did was floating point number handling and it is described and
implemented in lab6_extra.

We are supporting float type based on the language of l4.

The test cases for floating point are in the folder compiler/float_test/.

In order to run the tests, you would need to add 

int fti(float n);
void print_float(float n);

in the ../runtime/15411-l4.h0 and also add

int fti(float n) {
  return (int)n;
}

int print_float(float a) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%f\n", a);
  return 0;
}

into ../runtime/run411.c.

Moreover, you would need to change the Makefile under compiler/ to make lab6_extra, then you can run the same gradecompiler with -ellvm on the test cases.

The extra part still runs correctly on most of the original test suite, except for the cases with keyword "float".

There are two ways to represent float in our language, either with ".", like 1.0 or with "f", like 10f(only follows int).
